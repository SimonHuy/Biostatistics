# Biostatistics
Basic Statistics for Biologists

This project is designed to offer students at International University, Ho Chi Minh City, a solid grasp of statistics fundamentals. It tackles real-world problems and their solutions using both Python and Excel. Supplementary exercise files are included for those who wish to practice.

It is our hope that this project will not only assist students in successfully completing the Biostatistics module at the university but will also provide valuable skills for their future professions.
